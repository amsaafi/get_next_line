<h1>get_next_line</h1>

<p><code>get_next_line</code> is a function that reads a line from a file descriptor in C programming language. It provides a convenient way to read and process text from files, such as reading lines from a text file or parsing input from standard input.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Reads a line from a file descriptor, including newline characters.</li>
  <li>Supports reading from multiple file descriptors simultaneously.</li>
  <li>Handles dynamic memory allocation to accommodate lines of varying lengths.</li>
  <li>Provides a simple and straightforward interface for reading lines.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Include the <code>get_next_line.h</code> header file in your C source code.</li>
  <li>Compile your program with the <code>get_next_line.c</code> source file.</li>
  <li>Call the <code>get_next_line</code> function, passing the file descriptor as the first argument.</li>
  <li>The function returns 1 if a line was read successfully, 0 if the end of the file has been reached, and -1 if an error occurred.</li>
  <li>The line read is stored in a pointer provided as the second argument to the function.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Example</h3>

<pre><code>#include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include "get_next_line.h"

int main() {
    int fd = open("example.txt", O_RDONLY);
    if (fd == -1) {
        perror("Failed to open file");
        return 1;
    }

    char *line;
    int ret;

    while ((ret = get_next_line(fd, &line)) &gt; 0) {
        printf("Line: %s\n", line);
        free(line);
    }

    if (ret == -1) {
        perror("Failed to read file");
        close(fd);
        return 1;
    }

    close(fd);

    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Make sure to free the memory allocated for each line after you are done processing it to avoid memory leaks.</li>
  <li>The function assumes that the file descriptor is valid and opened in an appropriate mode for reading.</li>
  <li>Refer to the comments in the source code for more detailed information on the implementation and usage.</li>
</ul>
